Rent, loan, borrow with your doorstep neighborhood.</p><p>After having spent a whole sunday afternoon looking for a drill, I wish I could ask all my building neighbors in a snap knocking on each door. A drill, two seats, or a cooking instrument, just ask (or offer). Similar concepts appeared over the past few years, but they're not easy to use in large urban areas such as Paris, where a single kilometer can sometimes be synonym of a 20 minutes ride.</p><p>I first developed the platform to <span class=\"emphasis\">bring the service to the building I live</span>, and also to improve my skills, specifically on <span class=\"emphasis\">Amazon AWS ecosystem</span> which hosts the service. As a \"low-budget\" communication operation, I pitched the concept in the Paris subway to create a quick and original viral video.</p><p><span class=\"stack\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Stack:</span> Angular, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, Amazon AWS (EC2 / RDS / CloudFront / CloudWatch and related services)</span></p>",

With no communication, the app has been downloaded over 13 k times and 1.2 k in-app sold. The conversion ratio is pretty high, this topic seems to be a good incentive to drive users to actually pay the price of a coffee.</p><p><span class=\"stack\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Stack:</span> Swift, Angular, MongoDB, NodeJS, Nginx, Dedicated hosting</span></p>",
